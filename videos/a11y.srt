[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:10,640
ADDY OSMANI: Do you 
know what the top four

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,382
things to look at when it 
comes to web accessibility are?

4
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:15,161
MATT GAUNT: Uh, no.

5
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:16,161
I can only think of two.

6
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:18,680
Like, I only think of 
audio and then visual.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,400
ADDY OSMANI: So there's 
visual, hearing, mobility,

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,193
and cognition.

9
00:00:22,193 --> 00:00:23,519
MATT GAUNT: Ah, OK.

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,560
So what are the last two?

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,120
ADDY OSMANI: So mobility 
is where someone may not

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,580
be able to use a 
mouse, or they may

13
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,002
need to use a keyboard to 
navigate around all of your UI.

14
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:31,835
MATT GAUNT: OK, yep.

15
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:34,570
ADDY OSMANI: And 
cognition is where,

16
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,030
if you show somebody 
flashing text or a site

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,430
with lots of animation, that 
might cause an epileptic fit

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,600
or just cause them issues.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,020
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,520
I think I remember 
someone tweeting,

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,120
saying they had 
a condition where

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,150
if there was loads of parallax 
scrolling or something goes on,

23
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,860
it makes them feel really 
nauseous, because there's tons

24
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,054
of weird movements going on.

25
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:52,470
ADDY OSMANI: When 
doesn't parallax

26
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,928
scrolling make everyone feel 
nauseous is the real question.

27
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:56,140
MATT GAUNT: That's true.

28
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,640
ADDY OSMANI: So 
thankfully, there's

29
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,410
a few tools to help with web 
accessibility issue diagnosis.

30
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,290
We should go through them.

31
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,900
The first is the Chrome 
Accessibility Developer Tools,

32
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,502
which is like a Chrome 
extension you can grab.

33
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:11,960
I'm a bit of a 
douche, so I'm going

34
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,800
to run it against your site.

35
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,102
MATT GAUNT: Mine isn't too bad.

36
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:16,060
It's not great, though.

37
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,840
ADDY OSMANI: I guess 
we'll find out.

38
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,440
MATT GAUNT: Yes.

39
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,250
ADDY OSMANI: So we're going to 
hop into DevTools in the Audits

40
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,750
panel, check accessibility, 
and go and run it

41
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,320
against this site.

42
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,110
You've got a few passing 
tests, and you've

43
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,190
got a few tests that 
are not passing.

44
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,230
So we're going to look at those.

45
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,300
The first one is yellow 
and says the text

46
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,520
elements should have 
a reasonable contrast

47
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,512
ratio, Matthew.

48
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,970
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, I set the 
opacity low on some of the menu

49
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,890
items that aren't selected.

50
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,020
So I need to bump them up 
or find a different way

51
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,770
of visualizing it.

52
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,686
ADDY OSMANI: One of the 
nice things about this

53
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,440
is if you hover over 
any of the DOMNodes,

54
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,950
it will actually 
visualize it over

55
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,070
in the Preview pane, 
which is kind of cool.

56
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,778
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

57
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,270
So one of the other 
things I found,

58
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,640
because I have another issue 
on my site, which is the About

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,530
menu item doesn't 
actually explain anything

60
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,600
about what's going to happen.

61
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,123
But if you go into the 
Accessbility options,

62
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,706
like in the Elements 
panel, and you've

63
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:05,930
got the styles and 
computer styles,

64
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,150
there's an Accessibility 
drop-down that you get.

65
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,389
The nice thing with 
this is it actually

66
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,972
shows you what the 
screen reader would

67
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:13,792
say based on what it's got.

68
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:15,375
And the main reason 
I like this is, A,

69
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,885
it's a nice live representation.

70
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:18,260
It's something 
that's easy for me

71
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,050
to go, oh, OK, this is what 
the screen we would say.

72
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,530
But it also shows 
you area labels

73
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,780
that you could put that would 
affect the screen reader

74
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,150
and what it says, 
which I kind of like,

75
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,380
because I wouldn't have 
known what the right area

76
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,042
labels would have been.

77
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:33,250
So it's just kind of a nice 
way of educating yourself

78
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,860
as you're going 
along, figuring out

79
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,420
what you can change to 
get better screen reader

80
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,670
support or anything like that.

81
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,420
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

82
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,400
MATT GAUNT: It's nice.

83
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,730
ADDY OSMANI: So the 
thing that powers

84
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,900
the accessibility 
developer-produced extension

85
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,240
is actually called 
Accessibility Developer Tools.

86
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,710
It's like this node module-- 
it's not necessarily

87
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,460
just a node module, 
but basically, it

88
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,501
gives you all of the 
functionality that you might

89
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:56,550
need to go and run 
these tests locally

90
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,880
or hook up to 
continuous integration

91
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,020
in case you wanted to 
write accessibility tests

92
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,300
alongside your unit tests.

93
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,400
MATT GAUNT: Is that running 
it through something

94
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,430
like PhantomJS?

95
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,150
ADDY OSMANI: So I wrote 
a while back a module

96
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,530
called A11Y-- A-11-Y. It gives 
you basically a CLI and CI

97
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,760
module for doing that.

98
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,170
And you can just go and 
run it against Travis and--

99
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,340
MATT GAUNT: Nice.

100
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,756
ADDY OSMANI: --it'll 
do its thing.

101
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:21,060
MATT GAUNT: Drop in your CI.

102
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,326
ADDY OSMANI: Drop it in.

103
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,085
Have you heard of Tenon?

104
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:24,740
MATT GAUNT: (WHISPERING) 
Yes, I have.

105
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,200
ADDY OSMANI: You have?

106
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,730
You have.

107
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,740
So Tenon gives you 
this nice web UI

108
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,540
for just doing nice, basic 
web accessibility testing.

109
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,090
I run it against 
developers.google.com,

110
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,490
and we have a ton of missing 
alt attributes, which

111
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,630
we could probably fix up.

112
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,702
MATT GAUNT: So 
Tenon is super nice.

113
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:45,160
The only criticism 
I have with it--

114
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,493
it's great because you don't 
have to do any [INAUDIBLE].

115
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,731
It's super easy to get a 
gut check of where you are.

116
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,730
But the flip side is when 
I ran my site through,

117
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,270
it says there's no 
problems with it,

118
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,200
which we both know is now a lie.

119
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,510
So it's useful for a gut check.

120
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,027
And it's super low effort to 
get it running on your site.

121
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:04,050
But I question it, I guess.

122
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,740
ADDY OSMANI: So Tenon runs 
against the Web Content

123
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,907
Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.

124
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:10,990
And I think the Accessibility 
Developer Tools just

125
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,330
has a good set of general 
accessibility best practices

126
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,500
it tries to check against.

127
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,440
So they're checking for 
related but not necessarily

128
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,052
the exact same set of things.

129
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:21,760
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

130
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,635
ADDY OSMANI: They're 
both worth checking out.

131
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:26,420
MATT GAUNT: So the 
other one is tota11y.

132
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,040
ADDY OSMANI: Totally 
Tooling Tips?

133
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,980
MATT GAUNT: No.

134
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,080
T-O-T-A-1-1-Y. Basically, 
it's got a super awesome logo.

135
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,690
But what it is is it's 
basically a bookmarklet.

136
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,972
So you can drag it 
to your toolbar.

137
00:04:39,972 --> 00:04:41,930
And then when you're in 
your site, click on it,

138
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,340
and it adds a little button onto 
the bottom of your web page.

139
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,044
And the main reason it's 
nice is just the fact

140
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:50,210
that it breaks up all the 
different criteria of what

141
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,140
you could look for in 
terms of accessibility

142
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,710
into nice little chunks that 
you just focus on that one area.

143
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,710
And then it starts adding 
things into the page.

144
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,344
So with the contrast 
links, it will actually

145
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:02,510
hover over the buttons, add 
a little button, saying,

146
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,889
this is a problem area.

147
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:05,680
And it's just nice.

148
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,480
It's very lightweight, 
it's super simple.

149
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,280
And I think the way 
that it breaks stuff up

150
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,910
is if you've got a ton of 
stuff wrong with your site,

151
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,941
it's at least manageable chunks.

152
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,080
So I think it's just nice.

153
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
It's a nice little tool.

154
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,960
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

155
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,320
I've got to give a mention to 
ally.js by Rodney Rehm, which

156
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,577
is this little helper 
library that helps you

157
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:25,410
with some of the workflows 
you normally have

158
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,810
when you're trying to make 
your app a little bit more

159
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,720
accessible.

160
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,647
So it makes things like 
trying to figure out

161
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:31,730
what elements are considered 
focusable on the page

162
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,050
a little bit easier, 
trapping focus

163
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,949
navigation to a particular 
DOM subtree, something that

164
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,240
would have helped me, actually.

165
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,100
So I was trying to make 
this navigation drawer

166
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,820
keyboard-accessible 
the other day.

167
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,430
And I wanted to avoid you 
tabbing through the navigation

168
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,660
and then going back--

169
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,910
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, getting to--

170
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,230
ADDY OSMANI: --and it tabbing 
to the parts of the page.

171
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,420
So that might have 
helped with that.

172
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,020
And it's just really useful for 
querying the DOM for focusable

173
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,840
or tabbable elements.

174
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,460
Check it out.

175
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,660
It's pretty decent.

176
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,180
So I have some web 
accessibility pro tips.

177
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,930
MATT GAUNT: Go on.

178
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,840
ADDY OSMANI: They're 
not really pro tips.

179
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,510
I'm incompetent.

180
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,239
But they're good.

181
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,780
They're good things 
to watch out for.

182
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,100
MATT GAUNT: They're 
solid advice.

183
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,230
ADDY OSMANI: They're 
solid advice.

184
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,840
So the first thing 
to keep an eye on

185
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,300
is making sure that the 
components and elements

186
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,290
in your page can be 
accessed using a keyboard

187
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,497
and navigated around 
using a keyboard.

188
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:18,080
Next, make sure that 
your elements can

189
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,570
be used with a screen reader.

190
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,619
So for example, if I go to 
your website and I turn on--

191
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:24,952
SPEAKER 1: Welcome to Voiceover.

192
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:25,796
ADDY OSMANI: --voiceover--

193
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:27,270
SPEAKER 1: Voiceover 
speaks descriptions

194
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,270
of items on the screen.

195
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,986
ADDY OSMANI: It's 
basically what it does.

196
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:31,360
SPEAKER 2: Voiceover 
on Chromium.

197
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,161
Unit testing a service worker. 
[INAUDIBLE] vertical line

198
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:34,660
Matt Gaunt.

199
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,925
ADDY OSMANI: So it 
does all of that.

200
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:38,300
MATT GAUNT: The 
vertical line one

201
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,870
is the interesting one where 
I've somehow added my name

202
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,730
to the single vertical line.

203
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,440
So there's some issues there.

204
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,900
ADDY OSMANI: We've already 
discovered in this episode

205
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,733
that you have multiple 
issues with your site

206
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,132
probably worth checking out.

207
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:50,340
MATT GAUNT: [LAUGHS]

208
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,048
ADDY OSMANI: People 
should also make sure

209
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:54,380
that their apps 
work without sound.

210
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,760
So things like games might be 
worth keeping that in mind.

211
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,260
MATT GAUNT: Something like Air 
Horn, though, where all it is

212
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,907
is a button that makes a horn.

213
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:04,323
ADDY OSMANI: You could probably 
make that accessible, like

214
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,005
show a bubble or something.

215
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,421
MATT GAUNT: Because 
I didn't know.

216
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:10,240
It was just a text that 
just goes, whooo-on.

217
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,414
ADDY OSMANI: [LAUGHS] 
People should

218
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:14,080
make sure their apps 
work without color,

219
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,110
because some people are 
colorblind and don't see

220
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,277
the full spectrum of colors.

221
00:07:17,277 --> 00:07:17,943
MATT GAUNT: Yup.

222
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,650
ADDY OSMANI: And 
people should make sure

223
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,414
that their web apps work in 
high-contrast mode as well.

224
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:24,830
MATT GAUNT: Which is the problem 
that I've got on my site.

225
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,530
ADDY OSMANI: You have 
multiple problems, Matt.

226
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,696
These are just some of the 
ones that we can actually

227
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:29,600
address using tools.

228
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
MATT GAUNT: Thanks, man.

229
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,430
ADDY OSMANI: I try.

230
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,930
I try.

231
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,190
